title: How to ask for help
---

I believe the best way to ask for help depends on your question. If you're in the early stages and kind of plotting on how things should work, but the ideas aren't quite connecting, share your thoughts first and have an idea of what path it is you want to take. If you're already in the coding stages and everything is typed out the way you think it should work, but it's not, ask about part of your code or why the expected result is not what you're getting! I know that when I ask for help from now on I believe I understand the right approach rather than just go "I don't get this, fix it for me, please.".
