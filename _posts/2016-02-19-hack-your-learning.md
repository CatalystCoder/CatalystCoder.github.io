title: Hack your learning
---

Your probably wondering what it means when I say "Hack your learning", aren't you. It's a similar idea to life hacks. You find a way to better learn and build habits! A few ways I've started to do so is to use pomodoro and commit my work to github more often, so that way if I break something I can go back to the last working iteration and go from there if I've gone too far in the wrong direction. Another hack I've used is the "issues" section on github. It's helpful to line up what you want to accomplish and it feels great when you're able to check off all those tasks!
