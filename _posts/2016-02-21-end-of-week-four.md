title: End of Week 4
---

This week was a tougher week than the past few. There was a lot to learn with the database and web design. ActiveRecord has given me a bit of trouble as well. Having a partner to work with and throw ideas at makes things a lot easier than just sitting there and getting stuck on it alone. We've got what we needed to get accomplished though and we're moving right along to Week 5 already! Where does the time go? (Seriously?!) This week was also a bit trying as I caught the flu and was down for the count for a while but going into week 5 I'm hopeful for a quick recovery and some very awesome learning.
